# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate Resilience and Financial Commitments: Analysis of Disaster Trends and Environment Spending.

## Questions

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How have climate-related disasters evolved globally over the past decade?
Which regions or countries are most frequently affected by specific types of climate-related disasters?
What is the relationship between disaster frequency and the INFORM risk indices?
How do financial investments in environmental protection influence the effectiveness of disaster management?

## Description

<!-- Describe your  project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of climate-related disasters, focusing on how frequently specific disasters occur within various countries, and the corresponding financial investments made in mitigation and prevention. The study will leverage three datasets to explore the incidence of disasters like storms, floods, and landslides, compare these occurrences with the INFORM risk indices, and examine the financial efforts countries devote to disaster prevention.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasoruce # 1: Climate-related Disasters Frequency
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821_0.csv
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821_0/about
* Data Type: .csv

Global climate related disasters are stacked to show the trends in climate related physical risk factors.

### Datasource 2: Climate-driven INFORM Risk
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7cae02f84ed547fbbd6210d90da19879_0.csv
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/7cae02f84ed547fbbd6210d90da19879_0/about
* Data Type: .csv

The INFORM Risk Index is a global, open source risk assessment for crises and disasters. The Climate-driven INFORM Risk is an adaptation of the INFORM Risk Index, adjusted by IMF staff to distill and centralize on climate-driven risks

### Datasource 3: Government Expenditure on Environmental Protection
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d22a6decd9b147fd9040f793082b219b_0.csv
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/d22a6decd9b147fd9040f793082b219b_0/about
* Data Type: .csv

This data shows how much money each government spends on environmental protection measures, as a percentage of the countryâ€™s GDP

In general, the work packages are dependent on all previous ones. Therefore, the **work packages will be worked on in a sequential manner**.
Intra-work package dependencies are listed in the respective issues.

Issues are subject to change, therefore the issue-ID is not suitable to identify dependencies. 
Rather, the dependency list in each issue shall be used.
