# Project Plan

## Title
Energy consumption as driver of greenhouse gas emissions and the influence of renewables.

## Main Question

1. How does the amount of energy consumed influence the net greenhouse gas emissions of European countries?
2. And how is this influenced by the share of renewables in total energy?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Amongst other things like farming livestock, burning fossil fuels in order to consume its energy is one of the main emitting factors of greenhouse gases. Thereby it strongly influences global warming and climate change (see: [Causes of climate change](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/climate-change/causes-climate-change_en)).

This project aims to make visible, to what extent the amount of energy consumed influences global warming and climate change and how much the share of renewables in total energy consumption impacts the greenhouse gas emissions.

As indicator for climate change and global warming, the aforementioned net greenhouse gas emissions of a country are used, as they are associated to climate change (see: [Climate change: the greenhouse gases causing global warming](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230316STO77629/climate-change-the-greenhouse-gases-causing-global-warming)).

The approach is to connect data about a countryâ€™s reported net greenhouse gas emissions, the total energy consumed and its share of renewable energy sources in the consumed energy.
The resulting data will be contrasted based on the changes over the years and compared between all countries of the European Union.


## Datasources

### Datasource1: Net greenhouse gas emissions
* Metadata URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_13_10/default/table
* Data URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/sdg_13_10/?format=SDMX-CSV&i
* Data Type: SDMX-CSV 1.0
* Source of Data: [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_13_10/default/table)
* License: [Open Data License](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/about-us/policies/copyright)

Net greenhouse gas emissions for all countries in the european union either relative to 1990 or as tonnes per capita.

### Datasource2: Primary energy consumption
* Metadata URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_07_10/default/table
* Data URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/sdg_07_10/?format=SDMX-CSV&i
* Data Type: SDMX-CSV 1.0
* Source of Data: [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_07_10/default/table)
* License: [Open Data License](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/about-us/policies/copyright)

Energy consumption of end users like households or industry and the energy consumption of the energy sector itself, accounting for energy transformation costs.
The data is available for all countries of the european union.
Data is measured either as million tonnes of oil equivalent, relative to 2005 or as tonnes of oil equivalent per capita.

### Datasource3: Share of energy from renewable sources
* Metadata URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_ind_ren/default/table
* Data URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/nrg_ind_ren/?format=SDMX-CSV&i
* Data Type: SDMX-CSV 1.0
* Source of Data: [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_ind_ren/default/table)
* License: [Open Data License](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/about-us/policies/copyright)

The share of energy generated from renewable sources as declared by the european union. The data is available for all countries of the european union and is measured in percentages.
