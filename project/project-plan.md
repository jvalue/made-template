## Title

Tracking Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector to Understand Climate Change

## Main Question

How have greenhouse gas emissions from different sectors changed over time, and what does this mean for climate change?

## Description

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges we face today. This project will dig into historical data on greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors to uncover trends and identify major contributors to climate change. We'll analyze data from 1985 to 2022, focusing on methane (CH4) emissions, to see how they've shifted over the years and across different regions. Using advanced data engineering methods, we'll clean, process, and visualize the data to provide clear insights. These insights will help policymakers, researchers, and the public understand what measures have worked and where more effort is needed to reduce emissions.
