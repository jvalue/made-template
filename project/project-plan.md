# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Effects of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on emissions in europe and worldwide.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How significant is the impact of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in the sectors it sanctions and to what degree does that make an impact on global emissions.

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Reducing emissions is a critical step towards slowing down the effects of climate change. To tackle this issue, many countries are planning and have already enforced emissions trading systems. [1] Such trading systems set a price on the emission of CO2e to motivate producers and consumers of CO2e emitting products to reduce their carbon footprint. As these trading systems market themselves by claiming to reduce emissions, this trend should be visible when analyzing them. One system that makes sense to analyze is the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as it exists the longest (since 2005) and also generated much data since then. The goal of this project is thus to assess the significance of the EU ETS in reducing emissions inside of the EU by processing its European Union Transaction Log. Additionally the question of how much and how efficiently it impacts emissions on a global scale should be answered. Finally, answering these questions should help motivate having more and stricter emissions trading systems worldwide to help slow down climate change.
