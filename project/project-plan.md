# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate Change and it's burn on pocket - Cost of living crisis 

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does the rising global climate changes (especially increasing temperatures) affect the cost of living across the world?

2. Has rising global temperatures impacted the global crop production? 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

Climate change is a known enemy today for the world and it poses an existential threat to humanity across the world. Changing weather patterns, disappearing spring season, and unbearable summers have clarified the existence of the problem. Falling annual precipitations, ever-increasing droughts, and prolonged heat waves have impacted various sectors of the economies ranging from crop production and availability of drinking water to governments failing to achieve the climate targets. The most impact is borne by the people at the bottom of the financial pyramid, which leads to a cost of living crisis.
This project aims at finding facts from the data collected from various open sources and derive actionable insights which will give us a peek into what to expect from the future. The goal is to find trends that can help us mitigate the risks posed by climate change and ensure the availability and affordability of the basic needs for each and every person on the planet.  

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

This project is structured into six work packages, represented as [milestones in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/LisaRebecca/data-engineering-showcase/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open).
Each work package contains at least one issue. Issues are structured as follows:
```
1. Dependent on (Optional)
    - ...
2. Tasks
    - ...
3. Deliverables
    - ...
```

The subtasks and deliverables have to be submitted to mark an issue as completed.

1. Goal Formulation and Dataset selection [[WP1](https://github.com/shubby1996/made-template-23398853/issues/11)]
    1. Formulate a research question [[issue]()]
    2. Identify data sources [[issue]()]
    3. Assess the data sources [[issue]()]
2. Data Provisioning [[WP2]()]
    1. Identifying a suitable data storage format for the goal [[issue]()]
    2. Transforming the data into a suitable format [[issue]()]
    3. Making the datasources available to the project [[issue]()]
3. Data Exploration [[WP3]()]
    1. Perform exploratory data analysis and initial visualisation [[issue]()]
    2. Evaluate the data sources with respect to their ability to answer the initial research question [[issue]()]
    3. Select appropriate algorithms and approach to analysing the data [[issue]()]
4. Data Analysis [[WP4]()]
    1. Perform Data Analysis [[issue]()]
5. Evaluation [[WP5]()]
    1. Evaluate the analysis results [[issue]()]
6. Reporting Results [[WP6]()]
    1. Create appropriate visualisations [[issue]()]
    2. Making the repository presentable [[issue]()]
    3. Create final presentation [[issue]()]

In general, the work packages are dependent on all previous ones. Therefore, the **work packages will be worked on in a sequential manner**.
Intra-work package dependencies are listed in the respective issues.

Issues are subject to change, therefore the issue-ID is not suitable to identify dependencies. 
Rather, the dependency list in each issue shall be used.
