# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
MADE 24 SS - Analyzing Regional Impacts of Climate Change on Agricultural Yields.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How will projected climate changes impact agricultural yields across different regions globally?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change presents a significant threat to global food security by potentially disrupting agricultural production patterns. This project aims to analyze historical and projected climate data alongside agricultural yield data to assess the regional variations in the impact of climate change on crop yields.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
