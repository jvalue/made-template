# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate Disaster Trends and Inform Risk Correlation Analysis

## Questions

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How has the frequency of climate-related disasters evolved globally over the years?
2. Which nations or regions experience particular kinds of climate-related disasters most frequently?
3. Do more severe climate disasters occur in nations with higher inform risk indicators?

## Description

<!-- Describe your  project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The project will leverage two comprehensive datasets to explore the above questions. The datasets include information on the frequency of climate-related disasters and climate-driven INFORM risk indicators. By integrating and analyzing these datasets, the project aims to provide insights into the global trends of climate-related disasters, identify the most affected regions, and evaluate the correlation between disaster severity and risk indicators.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource # 1: Climate-related Disasters Frequency
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821_0.csv
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821_0/about
* Data Type: .csv

This dataset, sourced from EM-DAT by the Universit√© catholique de Louvain, tracks the frequency of various climate-related disasters globally from 1980 to 2022. It includes detailed records for different types of disasters such as droughts, floods, extreme temperatures, landslides, storms, and wildfires. Each entry specifies the country affected, the type of disaster, and the annual occurrence data. This dataset enables an analysis of trends over decades to understand how the frequency of these disasters has changed in response to global climate change.

### Datasource 2: Climate-driven INFORM Risk
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7cae02f84ed547fbbd6210d90da19879_0.csv
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/7cae02f84ed547fbbd6210d90da19879_0/about
* Data Type: .csv

The Climate-driven INFORM Risk Indicator, adjusted annually by IMF staff, provides a comprehensive assessment of the risk associated with climate-driven hazards. It focuses on three dimensions: hazard & exposure, vulnerability, and lack of coping capacity. Each country's data from 2013 to 2022 reflects the aggregated risk posed by potential climate-related events such as floods, tropical cyclones, and droughts. This dataset aids in evaluating the preparedness and vulnerability of different nations to handle climate-induced disasters.
