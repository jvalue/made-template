## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Energy consumption as driver of greenhouse gas emissions and the influence of renewables.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does the amount of energy consumed influence the net greenhouse gas emissions of European countries?
2. And how is this influenced by the share of renewables in total energy?

## Description
