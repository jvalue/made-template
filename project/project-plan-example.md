# Project Plan

## Title
Bicycle Sharing Traffic Flow in London

## Main Question

The main goal of this data engineering project is to integrate and analyze rental bicycle traffic and weather data for London to establish the city's suitability for cyclists. By examining trends in traffic counts from the London bike-sharing dataset from 1/1/2015 to 31/12/2016 and London's weather patterns, the project aims to determine if London's infrastructure and climate support a conducive and enjoyable cycling environment.

## Description

This data science initiative will examine bicycle traffic flow in London, using data from 1/1/2015 to 31/12/2016 bike rentals, and assess the city's weather patterns through data provided in Kaggle. The goal is to evaluate London's viability as a prime location for cycling enthusiasts. By analyzing the bicycle traffic trends and correlating them with weather and climate conditions, this project aims to uncover insights into the city's cycling-friendliness. The thorough investigation of London's cycling infrastructure and environmental factors will reveal if the city supports a robust and comfortable cycling culture.

Cycling Tourists: For tourists with a passion for cycling, the project's findings will be invaluable. The insights derived from the analysis of London's bicycle traffic and weather conditions will enable tourists to better plan their visits and cycling itineraries, potentially boosting the city's appeal as a tourist destination for cyclists.

Urban Planners in London: The insights garnered from this project can serve as a strategic tool for urban planners, helping to enhance the quality and safety of the city's cycling infrastructure. By pinpointing specific areas where cycling facilities are lacking, city planners can strategically direct investments to upgrade and expand infrastructure, thereby fostering a more accessible and enjoyable cycling environment in London.
