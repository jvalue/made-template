# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Comparative Analysis of Cancer Characteristics

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do the characteristics and patterns of breast cancer (as measured by attributes like radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.) differ between various cities in India?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
 This question would involve comparing the detailed breast cancer data from the first dataset with the incidence data from different cities in the second dataset.
