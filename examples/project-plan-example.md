# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Traffic Analysis project

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1) Object detection and tracking in traffic camera feeds.
2) Traffic analysis and congestion prediction.
3) Road safety and accident prevention.
4) Urban planning and smart city development.
## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The aim of this project is to develop a robust system for real-time traffic detection and analysis to aid urban planning and optimize transportation infrastructure in urban areas of Germany.
Demonstration of real-time traffic detection and analysis capabilities. Positive feedback from city planners and transportation authorities.Measurable improvements in traffic flow and congestion management.
This project aims to leverage data engineering and analysis techniques to contribute to the development of smarter and more efficient urban transportation systems in Germany.

* Data Type: txt

Diverse Geographic Coverage: this dataset encompasses traffic camera images from different countries, providing a global perspective on traffic monitoring and management.

High-Quality Annotations: Each image is meticulously annotated using bounding boxes to identify various objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs, making it perfect for object detection tasks.

Varied Environmental Conditions: The dataset includes images captured under different weather conditions, lighting, and traffic scenarios, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Training-Ready: This dataset has been used successfully to train a YOLOv5 object detection model, achieving an impressive Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.89, Precision (P) of 0.88, and Recall (R) of 0.89, ensuring that it's ready for immediate use in your own projects.

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. Conduct basic statistics, visualizations, and summary reports on the dataset to understand its characteristics.
3. Identify key features that are likely to influence salary predictions.
4. Decide on which regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest). Exploring other machine learning algorithms for the task.
5. Fine-tune model parameters (e.g., learning rate, max depth) to optimize performance.
6. Analyze which features have the most influence traffic using techniques like permutation importance.
7. Analyze data to determine traffic analysis and congestion prediction.
8. Document the methodology, findings, and recommendations in a comprehensive report.
9. Deploy the trained model to make real-time predictions (Optional).
